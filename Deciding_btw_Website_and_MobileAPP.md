•First, you should always consider first building a website before a mobile app
    Here's Why:
        •Time to market - it's faster and easier to build a website and you can test your assumptions more quickly
        •Simplicity - It's easier to make changes to the site as your learning in the begining. 
              •When you're innovating quickly, you want yo be able to make quick changes
              •You do not need to get permission from Apple
              •Users do not need to download a new version to see changes
        •Reach - a website covers more potential reach than a mobile app - easier to spread
        •Skills - access to more website developers
        •Affordability - less costly to make a website
        
•Think about integration - does you product require integration with other apps/features on the phone? Can those features be created through a website?
•What are the things you can't do on a site that you can do on an app?

Building a Mobile App:
      You have 3 main options
          1) Phone Gap or Cordova or Ionic
                •These are tools to build a mobile app that can be accessed across platforms (iPhone, Android, etc..)
                •They are quick and easy to build, relavtive to the other way
                •They are open source
                •Free
                •You could get something upp in 4 days
                •Built in html
                •Features are available 
                •Can perform almost as quickly
          2) Titanium Appcelerator
                •Looks more native
                •Similar to a framework 
          3) Native App
                •A native app is soley for a specific platform
                •Does NOT wor across platforms
                •A native iPhone app is only for iPhones
                •The look, feel, and function is the most responsive and integrated
                •More costly
                •Takes more time to build
                •Limits to only one type of platform user
                •Less develepers with skills for each
