The document presents top three things managers to keep in mind from a hiring and performance management perspective:

Hiring: 
1.	Difference between a good programmer and great programmer is 10x. Hire developers who are passionate about coding could make a huge difference. 
2. High number of programming languages is a plus but should not be a basis for selection
3. Test developer on problem solving skills and the way they structure the algorithms.


Performance Management:
1.	The amount of effort a developer has put should not be measured by the number of lines a developer codes. A really valuable piece of code that took hours can be written in a couple of lines. Instead, to measure effort, regular weekly checkins are super valuable.
2.	Salary pay based on number of hours is not a good idea because managers then push developers to finish the project as soon as possible. This can lead to suboptimal output. Hence, in those cases, a lump sum amount for the whole project is a good idea. 
3.	Going open-source has its benefits: In that case, it allows developer to clean the code before he puts on Github. The company can also leverage the crowd-sourcing benefits
