The document presents top three things managers to keep in mind from a hiring and performance management perspective:

Hiring: 

1.	Difference between a good programmer and great programmer is 10x. Hire developers who are passionate about coding could make a huge difference. 
2.	Ask for references as they can really help identifying exceptional programmers
2. High number of programming languages is a plus but should not be a basis for selection
3. Test developer on problem solving skills and the way they structure the algorithms. e.g., Ask him to do a 2 hours project, where he should solve a reasonably complex problem in a short period of time.
4. Think about the fit that developer has with your project. For instance, if you're working on an education project, hiring developers who are passionate about education should improve the final results of the project.

Performance Management:

1. The amount of effort a developer has put should not be measured by the number of lines a developer codes. A really valuable piece of code that took hours can be written in a couple of lines. Instead, to measure effort, regular weekly checkins are super valuable.
2. Make sure the developer uses the right framework to write software. If he/she doesn't know the concepts of Continuous Development or Lean/Kanban, for instance, probably you are going to experience problems whenever testing and shipping your software.
3. Ensure responsibilities are neatly divided. The developer knows the parameters and the managers who'll be responsible for his performance evaluation.
4. 2. Salary pay based on number of hours is not a good idea because managers then push developers to finish the project as soon as possible. This can lead to suboptimal output. Hence, in those cases, a lump sum amount for the whole project is a good idea.
5. Going open-source has its benefits: In that case, it allows developer to clean the code before he puts on Github. The company can also leverage the crowd-sourcing benefits
