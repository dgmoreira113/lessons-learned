Continuous delivery is a software development technique that ensures that each of the software features gets built, tested and merged into production in a faster and more reliable way. This approach has been used by successful tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google.
By continuously reassessing each feature, getting usersâ€™ feedback and incorporating those enhancements into the pieces of the software, the software engineer can quickly incorporate any changes and be ready to launch the software at any point in time. Ultimately the goal is not only to speed up the development process, but also to be able to react to changes in the scope of the project originated by changes in the business strategy, user preferences or competitors movements.
Continuous delivery builds on the concept of Continuous Integration, which means that every developer to keep his or her work-in-progress continually integrated with every other developer. Therefore, CI is the first step of the continuous delivery pipeline and the foundation of the continuous delivery process. In order to efficiently apply continuous delivery to your software development process, the software engineer should use tools for version control, build automation, unit testing and integration testing, among others.
The benefits of using continuous delivery are, among others, accelerated time to market, improved product development assertiveness and quality, higher productivity and efficiency in the development process, more reliable releases, and, ultimately, improved customer satisfaction.
