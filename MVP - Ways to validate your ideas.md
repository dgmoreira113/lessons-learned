WHY TO BUILD AN MVP

A minimum viable product allows you to validate the assumption that the business you are trying to pursue is worth being build. Therefore, the key metric of success is not how much sales the project generates, but how much you learn about the subject. 

By using such approach, you can accelerate and reduce the cost of failure, avoid building a product or a company that should never have existed from the beginning. 

Some questions you should try to answer are the following:

•	Do we understand our customer's problem or need?
•	Enough people care about this problem or need so that we can create a business around it?
•	Will people care enough to tell their friends and help your business grow?

HOW TO CREATE A MVP

First of all, if you are working in a corporate environment remember not to call your MVP a “product”. By doing so you activate corporate immune system that will keep you from even starting. In order to avoid this kind of obstacle, call it an “experiment”. Apparently nobody cares about “experiments”.

The idea is to create the simplest pass/fail test that will allow you to learn what you need to learn. 
There are several ways to test your idea without incurring in large initial costs. Here follow some examples:

•	Flyers: this is probably the simplest way to evaluate if someone really has a need for your solution. You can measure how long it takes for people to take all the tickets.
•	Landing page: do a simple landing page explaining what product you are trying to solve, what is your value proposition, and a call to action to sign up to learn more. You can measure interest by the number of page views and signups you get.
•	A/B testing: if you have a website and is not sure what feature to launch, include links for your most promising ideas and check interest by measuring number of page views and give customers the possibility to sign up to be contacted once the feature is ready. 
•	LoF (Low Fidelity): instead of creating the full product with all the possible features clients might want to see, think what the most relevant feature the product must have is and what the simplest way to develop it. If customers are willing to use your product even though the solution is not ideal, you are probably solving a real problem.  
•	Kickstarter: there are two big upsides in using Kickstarter: first, in order to launch a campaign, all you need is a video; second, if you succeed, you have preorders of customers that are willing to pay for your product. 
•	E-mail only start-up: it is easier to build an email-first product than a website or a mobile application. This an interesting article about the subject http://ryanhoover.me/post/43986871442/email-first-startups. 

Remember that doesn’t matter which option you choose, in this phase of the project, you must optimize the project not for profit, but for learning.
